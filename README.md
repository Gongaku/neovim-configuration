# Neovim Configuration
This repository contains my dotfiles for Neovim. There are probably better configurations, be they more efficient, complex, or better-looking, but this is mine to play with.

This requires a Neovim version of 12+ as this config relies on using the native neovim packer introduced in this version.

## Installation
Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gongaku:neovim-configuration $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim
```

Open Neovim so that `vim.pack` activates and downloads repositories.
